            <p class="about-description">I am a PhD candidate at Washington State University (WSU), specializing in optimal power flow and reinforcement learning for distribution system regulation and restoration.
            I come from Madhya Pradesh, India. I am always excited to solve difficult problems in the domain and beyond. At WSU, I am under the supervision of Dr. Anamika Dubey and Dr. Anjan Bose. Before this, I did both B.Tech. and M.Tech. (5-year dual degree course) from an institute of national importance and eminence, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhubaneswar, under the supervision of Dr. Chandrashekhar N. Bhende.
            I enjoy collaborating with others and approaching research problems that transcend branch-boundaries of engineering and science.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a >B.Tech. Project:   ”Machine learning-based Volt-Var Control of PV-based Inverters for Voltage Regu
lation in Distribution Systems”. This work proposes a novel neural-network-driven volt-var control
 (NNVVC). Furthermore, the proposal for a decentralised NNVVC is discussed. Also, this work proposes
 a unique reinforcement learning agent based volt-var control that has proven to be even more promising
 than NNVVC. This approach empowers localised control with reduced communication complexity and fast
 online real-time power dispatch response.</a></li>
            <li><a >M. Tech. Project:   ”Intelligent Approaches to the Restoration and Regulation of Power Distribution Sys
tems”. This work aims to model the power distribution systems and active distribution systems through
 straightforward mixed integer linear programming and leverage the prompt decision-making capability of
 reinforcement learning agents to improve the restoration process of the power distribution systems and the
 regulation of high-RES-rich active distribution systems. Here, for restoration, we also make use of network
 reconfiguration and remote-controlled switches, along with the integration of renewable energy resources in
 the modified IEEE 33 bus environment. Furthermore, reinforcement learning (RL) and physics-informed
 learning (PhIL) are used for voltage regulation in accordance with the IEEE 1547 grid code. PhIL is imple
mented on the standard IEEE 33 bus system with considerable PV penetration and to make the learning
 explainable. Further, RL is implemeted on IEEE 33 bus system, for unbalancing mitigation on IEEE 123
 bus system.</a></li>
